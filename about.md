Hello! I'm Enica!

I'm an Italian 28 y/o girl based in Dublin, in love with blogging and social media.

I was born in a small mountain village among cows, woods and beautiful landscapes: for this reason I grew up with the idea that one day I'd left the mountains to discover what is over them. And that's what I did.

I started to travel in order to dig deep into myself to discover my values, my dreams and purpose. Allthesmalltrips.life is the way I choose to share to the world my thoughts, experiences and misadventures!
