Hello! I'm Enica!

I'm an Italian girl in love with blogging and social media.
I was born in small mountain village among cows, woods and beautiful landscapes for this reason I grew up with the idea the after my high school degree I'll left the moiuntains to discover what there's over them. And that's what I did.
