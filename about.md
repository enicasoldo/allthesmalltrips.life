Hey guys!

Welcome on "All the small trips"!

Here I'll show you the way to discover the world step by step, weekend by weekend, trip by trip.
On my blog you will find how there's no need to leave your job and travel the world for one year to become a true traveler.

I am an Italian girl based in Dublin. During the last years I traveled a lot throughout Europe, especially Belgium where I lived before I've moved to Ireland.
Blogging and travels are my passions: with my posts I'd like to share wit you my thoughts, experiences and misadventures.

I'd glad to know your impressions and you own experiences: please don't hesitate to contact me!
