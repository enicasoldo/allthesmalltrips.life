Hello! I'm Enica!

I'm an Italian girl based in Dublin, in love with blogging and social media.

I was born in a small mountain village among cows, woods and beautiful landscapes for this reason I grew up with the thing that one day I'd left the mountains to discover what there's over them. And that's what I did.

To travel was the only way to dug deep into myself to discover my values, my dreams and purpose.
