Hey travelers!

"All the small trips" is the way I offer you to discover the world step by step, weekend by weekend, trip by trip.
On my blog you will find how as there's no need to leave your job and travel the world in one year to become a true traveler.

My name is Enica, an Italian girl based in Dublin. During the last two years I traveled a lot throughout Europe, especially Belgium where I lived before to move to Ireland.
Blogging and travels are my passions so this is the place at my best.





I started to travel in order to dig deep into myself to discover my values, my dreams and purpose. Allthesmalltrips.life is the way I choose to share to the world my thoughts, experiences and misadventures!
