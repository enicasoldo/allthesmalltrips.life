Hey guys!

Welcome to "All the small trips"!

Here I'll show you how to discover the world step by step, weekend by weekend, trip by trip.
On my blog you'll find there's no need to leave your job and travel the world for one year to become a true traveler.

**My slogan is: be travelers, not tourists!**

I am an Italian girl based in Dublin. During the last years I've traveled a lot throughout Europe, especially Belgium where I've lived before I moved to Ireland.
Blogging and travels are my passions: with my posts I'd like to share with you my thoughts, experiences and misadventures.



I'd be glad that you contributed to the blog with your opinions and experiences: don't be shy!
