Hey travelers!

"All the small trips" is the way I offer you to discover the world step by step, weekend by weekend, trip by trip.
On my blog you will find how as there's no need to leave your job and travel the world in one year to become a true traveler.

I am an Italian girl based in Dublin. During the last two years I traveled a lot throughout Europe, especially Belgium where I lived before before moving to Ireland.
Blogging and travels are my passions so this blog  is the perfect place to share with you my thoughts, experiences and misadventures!
