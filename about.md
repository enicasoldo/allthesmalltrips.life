Hey guys!

Welcome to "All the small trips"!

Here I'll show you how to discover the world step by step, weekend by weekend, trip by trip.

On my blog you'll find there's no need to leave your job and travel the world for one year to become a true traveler.

I've always believed that to take the most of your travels is not only important to see places and to do things but, above all, understand new cultures, meet people and even to change your mind.

**My slogan is: be travelers, not tourists!**

I am an Italian girl based in Dublin.
During the last years I've traveled a lot throughout Europe, especially Belgium where I lived before I moved to Ireland.

Blogging and travels are my passions: with my posts I'd like to share with you my thoughts, experiences and misadventures.

I'd be glad that you contributed to the blog with your own _small trips_ and opinions: don't be shy, write to me!
