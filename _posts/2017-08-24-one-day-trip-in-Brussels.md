Why Brussels should be in your European travel list


I have been in Belgium several times in the last two years but I haven’t visit its capital until last August. So I set to explore this city in a one day trip before leaving Flanders: I could never move away without see Brussels, heart of Europe and multicultural community example.

Brussels is only one hour by train from Antwerp, the city where I live: 60 km that draws all the possible differences that could exist between cities in the same country.  The Belgian capital is a fairly compact city where It is easy to go around by foot for a seesighting of the main spots of interest.

Like I did for Copenhagen, I booked the free tour with SANDEMAN’s NEW Europe tours: it is a valiant option if you prefer to enjoy a new city  in an unconventional way.  The guides are more experienced and enthusiastic compared to the classical tourist tours and they usually are young and motivated. I fell in love with these kind of making tours because they perfectly reflect my way of traveling: not just see places and do things, but also understand cultures, meet people and even change your mind.

My walking tour with the nice Magali started at 11 AM in Grand Place,  the central square in the city and UNESCO World Heritage site. Every main city in Belgium and Netherlands has its Grote Markt, which is a common name of centrally located historic market square.Three historical buildings rise up in Brussels Grote Markt: the Town Hall, The Breadhouse and the guildhalls. I was amazed by the particular architecture and history of the town hall: it is the only one wholly survived to the the Second World War which is full of curiosities and legends.
It was a lucky trip for me because I visited Brussels just the 15th of August. In effect, when I got there, I discovered that every two years, only in August, the whole square is transformed into a giant flower carpet thanks to the millions of begonias brought there to create a colourful masterpiece.
