I have been in Belgium several times in the last two years but I haven’t visited its capital until last August. So I set to explore this city on a one day trip before leaving Flanders: I could have never moved away without seeing **Brussels, the heart of Europe and multicultural community example**.

>_Brussels is only one hour by train from Antwerp, the city where I lived: 60 km that draws all the possible differences that could exist between cities in the same country.  The Belgian capital is a fairly compact city where It is easy to go around by foot for a sightseeing of the main spots of interest_.

Like I did for [Copenhagen](http://allthesmalltrips.life/trips/2017/07/19/3-perfect-days-Copenhagen.html), I booked the free tour with SANDEMAN’s NEW Europe tours: it is a valiant option if you prefer to enjoy a new city in an unconventional way.  The guides are more experienced and enthusiastic compared to the classical tourist tours and they usually are young and motivated. I fell in love with this kind of making tours because they perfectly reflect my way of traveling: **not just see places and do things, but also understand cultures, meet people and even change your mind**.

My walking tour with the nice Magali started at 11 AM in Grand Place,  the central square in the city and UNESCO World Heritage Site. Every main city in Belgium and Netherlands has its Grote Markt, which is a common name of the centrally located historic market square.Three historical buildings rise up in Brussels' **Grote Markt**: the **Town Hall**, The **Breadhouse** and the **guildhalls**. I was amazed by the particular architecture and history of the town hall: it is the only one wholly survived to the Second World War which is full of curiosities and legends.

It was a lucky trip for me because I visited Brussels just the 15th of August. In effect, when I got there, I discovered that every two years, only in August, the whole square is transformed into a **giant flower carpet** thanks to the millions of begonias brought there to create a colorful masterpiece.

Just a few blocks from the Grand Place you stumble across the Belgium famous **Manneken Pis**,   a tiny fountain depicting a young boy peeing. There has been much speculation about the origins of this hilarious bronze sculpture: the truth is that nobody knows who he was and why has become the symbol of a country! The funny thing is that the small statue has a range of clothes made for him; they’re about over 900 outfits, all of them set in a museum and known as GardeRobe. Come back in Christmas Day to see him in a Santa outfit!

After a quick look after the “little boy”, I head to a lively corner next **Place de la Bourse**, a square most of the time neglected by travel blogs and avoided by guides. Once this place was afflicted by the terrible plague and for that completely razed. Long after the Belgians built here a stunning neoclassical Stock Exchange building that nowadays hosts exhibitions and events!

I particularly enjoyed to take a stroll across these cheerful pathways: bars, pubs, and shops are everywhere while at [Fritland](http://www.fritlandbrussels.be/acceuil), in Rue Henri Maus, you could taste the best fries ever.
**A tip**: locals suggested not to ask for “French” fries, they are extremely sensitive about it. It’s better if you order “Belgian fries” or simply “fries”.
**Look**: authentic “frietjes” are cooked with lard and not with vegetal oil, that’s the secret of their flavorful.


The **Galleries Royals Saint Hubert** was a real discovery for me. I looked up at it and I said: “They have made a copy of the one of Milan!”. Instead, it is just the opposite thing! The ones of Milan and Naples were inspired by the Brussels’ Gallery that opened in 1847.  It was designed as a commercial building for the aristocracy and consists of two main sections, the King’s Gallery and the Queen’s Gallery, and a smaller side called Princess’ gallery.
Today it hosts over 50 shops and two theaters. According to a historical anecdote, the Lumière brothers played here one of their first movies.
**Recommendation**: you can’t leave this Gallery (and Brussels in general) without to buy, or at least to taste, the delicious Belgian chocolates. Avoid franchise and commercial shops: you may have the best chocolates of Belgium at **Mary’s** (the first Chocolate shop owned by a woman) and at **Neuhaus** (which invented the famous Pralines).

When I stood in front of the **Cathedral of Saint Michael and Gudula** the first thing I thought was “Notre-Dame!”. In effect this building, that is also UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a typical gothic church with stained glasses and lancet arches. Belgian people are extremely respectful of religion and spirituality. Please, if you decide to enter this sacred space, be silent and respectful too.

The **Royal Palace of Brussels** is open to the public two weeks per year, usually in summer. It is possible to walk beautiful golden rooms, the old team rooms and  bedrooms where kings and queens succeeded over centuries. Today the Belgian royals have turned into a modern family very close to Belgians and involved in the current issues of their Country.

Brussels, like every capital in the world, is a mix of “night and day”. Indeed, during the centuries, Belgium was characterized by colonialism, wars, slavery but also courage and a great humility. King Albert I, a true national hero of the I World War, was a small brave man which fought to protect the neutrality and the peace of his people. “Belgium is a Country, not a road”, he answered to Germany. His strength and integrity are still impressed in the Belgians which celebrates him with a huge statue in the Mont des Arts.
This is Belgium: a strategic born Nation which, over few decades, has raised his own dignity and strength despite its small measures.
