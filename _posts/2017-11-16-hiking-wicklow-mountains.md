_Ireland is one of those countries whose countryside is as stunning as its cities.
Dublin's gives you the opportunity to have a great hiking experience thanks to many mountains trails in the inland and such a beautiful coastwise paths too._

### Why spend one day of your trip by hiking


Best travel writers said that **you haven't been to Ireland unless you've hike in the rain**: this is why since I landed in Dublin I was determined to hike as soon as possible!

Dublin city is as amazing as his rural area: lakes, glacial valleys, mountains with cute deers and stags following you while you're walking. So, if you are interested in the **authentic Ireland**, visiting cities and history museums is not enough.

Despite of the weather, **Irish people love country life** and do a lot of outdoor sports: they even invented many singular team sports played on _open air_ like hurling and they, obviously, hike a lot to take the most of the natural heritage Ireland is provided.

Although Dublin is going to become the "European Silicon Valley" (or maybe it is already), with millions people come here to work in IT companies and starts up, Irish have changed nothing of their lifestyle. They still enjoy to have breakfast with their ( terrible) porridge and to go outdoor every weekend to hike, climb, camp or surf. It doesn't matter if it is rainy, snowing or it's too windy even to walk: **once a week  true Irish need their weekly dose of nature.**

### Why choose the Wicklow Mountains

There are a lot of hiking trails near Dublin but, if you have a car, the best one is the Wicklow Way in the **Wicklow Mountains**.
The County of Wicklow, two hours South of Dublin, is called **the garden of Ireland** and it's a true walkers' paradise. This "Way" was the first such trail in Ireland, formally established in 1980.

The main reason I chose the Wicklow Way as my first hiking experience is that it's a **mix of nature and history**: _en route_, the Wicklow Way passes through mountain lakes but also ruined buildings, occasional memorials to past centuries events and, the last but not the least, the famous extensive remains of Glendalough, the early Christian monastic settlement in the beautiful Glendalough valley.

The **Wicklow Way** begins in Dublin's southern suburb of Rathfarnham and travels in a south-south-westerly direction to finish in the small village of Clonegal, 127 kilometres later.

Since it was my first experience as a "hiker", I obviously opted to walk only part of the Wicklow Way: hiking the whole trail takes several days and it requires an athletic training I was not provided when I arrived in Dublin.


### The white route

Among the routes I could choose, the **White Route** was the one that made me curious the most.  It is the perfect choice for ones has no particular fitness training, but who don't want to miss the opportunity to enjoy the breathtaking landscape you can admire only from the top of mountains.

But my adventure began even before to arrive to the start point. As soon as we left behind the city, we started to drive along country roads crossed by **sheep** and **goats** and overflew by **ravens**, **kestrels** and **merlins**: it has been about two hours of rally aboard a city car!

After we having parked our car, my real adventure began... in the most disastrous way ever! The first metres of the white route are the worst: it was all uphill while I was walking close to amazing **falls** and nice animals I couldn't enjoy because I was too busy keeping myself alive!

Although scared by this bad starting, our path got well with some long flat trails or someone shorter to climb. Now I could finally appreciate the landscape: the **Upper Lake** from above is something amazing, it seems to me a huge volcano filled with water: like a postcard!

![Stags on our route](/assets/images/stags.jpg)

Unfortunately, on mountains the weather changes very fast so, just after the "terrible" climb, it started to rain. Although it rained, once reached the highest point, I saw for the first time a **stag** few metres from me, looking at us and jumping. It was so excited!

The way back ran downhill but a it was little bit difficult because of rocky trail. We discovered with surprise that now we were walking on a geological s between granite and mica schist bedrock. Up to  the 1965 that was a stone mine and it is still possible to see a building of the abandoned Miners' Village.

Our route ended with a forest trail, full of butterflies flying over: it was amazing walking by the lake while local people, that is used to walk there with its dogs, was greeting us nicely.

9 kilometres distance, estimated time of 3 hours and half,380 metres total height climbed, highest point 500 metres, terrain underfoot of rocky trail, boardwalk and forest roads: if I did it, everyone does!


### Remember to organise your backpack well

Before I came to Ireland I wasn't used to go out when it's rainy. But in Dublin, you can't wait for the perfect weather conditions to do what you like:  weather changes many times and very fast in a single day.

To go hike without accidents, it is essential to wear the right outfit and to organise the backpack. Unfortunately, during my first time on the Wicklow way, I was too inexperienced to consider that my new sneakers and a cotton sweater were the worst choice ever to hike under the rain...

So now, I want to share with you what to do to avoid common mistakes people make when they hike for the first time.

The keyword for your hiking outfit is **waterproof**: wear a rainproof jacket and sweatpants at least.

**A Tip**: take with you a clean change of clothes, in the case of insistent and copious rain, you don't have to wait to be home to wear dry clothes.

If you have time, buy specific **hiking boots**: during my first experience I wore a pair of sneakers that I don't suggest you; especially  along the rocky trails, I had some problems with my ankles that you can easily avoid with the right shoes.

For what concern your backpack, first of all, take with you a lot of water and, some dark chocolate or protein bars and, if you want, also some sandwiches for the lunch.

_Once I arrived on the top, while I saw that incredible landscape I feel so grateful for what nature give us that I thought the sandwich I ate was the best one in the world._

**One advice**: When you prepare the sandwiches for your lunch remember that you need proteins: less junk food, more ham.

It would have been a perfect hiking if only I had considered what I' am telling you now!


Since this my first day in the Wicklow mountains, I couldn't stop to think of the the fictional character of Scarlett O'Hara and at her visceral way to love the land she got from her Irish father. Today  The Irish are just like this: **they love every tree, stone and sheep of their Country and they try to enjoy them as much as possible.**
