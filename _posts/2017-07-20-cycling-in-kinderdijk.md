You cannot understand Netherlands and its people without visiting **Kinderdijk**. It is the place were Dutch invented a way to turn a marshy land into an inviting and fertile one that even the Romans considered hostile. As a matter of fact, people here say:  

> **“God created Earth, but Dutch created Holland”**

Kinderdijk is a small village, 16 kilometers from Rotterdam, **World Heritage Site** since 1997. It is made up by **19 windmills** scattered across the boundless Dutch plain!
Not everyone knows that the 25% of Netherlands is constant at risk of flooding, because of its position below the sea level.

> These lands were the first experiments of **Polder**, areas once invaded by the sea, reclaimed by dams, channels and mills.

I reached Kinderdijk by car from Antwerp: It was very simple, parking are free and the mills’ Site is very close to the town. I have read that the best way to visit Kinderdijk is by bike in fact, the windmills area is huge and, in spring, sun hammers down. You can make the most out the beauty of Kinderdijk by cycling between the canals, this is all worth it ! Crossing this land by foot it'a s whole different experience because it could be very hot, and by walking you can't feel the wind on your skin. So, rent a bike in one of the restaurants just out the site entrance and:

> **“Enjoy the land, the wind and the water!”**

**Remember**: buy the full ticket. lt includes a video history about Dutch Polder and the visit inside mills. I think it is useful to get into the spirit of this Land and, in addition, all tickets money are allocated to the Site’s maintenance.

**Only one of the mills of Kinderdijk, the Nedrwaardmolen 2, is open** to visitors and offers an overall view of the ancient functioning and living conditions of its inhabitants. Take a stop here during your cycling tour and the deepest side of miller’s life.

Residing and working in a mill was not easy: the millers used to have 10 or 12 children and lived thanks to the fruits of the land, cattle breeding and fishing. **They needed to live in the mills because they had to constantly monitor the water level** and possibly intervene following the wind direction and changing the position of blades.


To visit the only one open mill to the public will make you discover **unexpected things**: the entrance doors, for example, were small because the feeding at the time was very poor and unequal.
The life of millers and his family was distributed among the four floors of windmills. The parents' living room and bedroom was on the ground floor, the children's rooms on the upper floor, the attic where the fish caught due to the presence of the terminal part of the Fireplace on the third floor, the mill's gears at the fourth and the rotating cover, capable of rotating up to 360 ° according to the wind direction on the top floor.

Just a **tip**: take your lunch bag from home and eat your sandwich on the canal’s stage among waterlilies, dragonflies and enclosed by the beautiful landscape.

After the Second World War, mills stopped working and were replaced by a large and efficient water pumping station. Apart from the one opened to visits, the other 18 mills are privately owned. **In summer they contribute to making the landscape beautiful and plunging visitors to another era with blades that rotate as if nothing had changed since the 18th century.**

> Kinderdijk is a place to visit once in a lifetime. To stand in front of this engineering wonder, you realize how men can manipulate earth for their own advantage and, at the same time, respect nature’s ecosystems.
