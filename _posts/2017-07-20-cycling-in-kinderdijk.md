**Kinderdijk** (Holland) is a small village, 16 kilometers from Rotterdam, **World Heritage Site** since 1997 . It is made up by 19 windmills scattered across the Dutch plain! 
Not everyone knows that the 25% of Netherlands is constant under at risk of flooding, because of its position below the sea level. These lands were the first experiments of Polder, areas once invaded by the sea, reclaimed by dams, channels and mills. 

The best way to visit Kinderdijk is by bike. The **windmills** area is huge and, in spring, sun hammers down.

Only one of the mills of Kinderdijk, the **Nedrwaardmolen 2**, is open to visitors and offers an overall view of the ancient functioning and living conditions of its inhabitants. Take a stop here during your cycling tour and the deepest side of miller’s life.

Residing and working in a mill was not easy: the millersi used to have 10 or 12 children and lived thanks to the fruits of the land, cattle breeding and fishing. They were forced to live in the mills because they had to constantly monitor the water level and possibly intervene following the wind direction and changing the position of blades.

To visit of the only open mill to the public will make you discover unexpected things: the entrance doors, for example, were small because the feeding at the time was very poor and unequal

Between the four levels, the life of the miller and his family was distributed: the parents' living room and bedroom on the ground floor, the children's rooms on the upper floor, the attic where the fish caught due to the presence of the terminal part of the Fireplace on the third floor, the mill's gears at the fourth and the rotating cover, capable of rotating up to 360 ° according to the wind direction on the top floor. 

After the Second World War, mills stopped working and were replaced by a large and efficient water pumping station. Apart from the one that can be visited, the other 18 mills are privately owned but in the summer they contribute to making the landscape beautiful and plunging visitors to another era with blades that rotate as if nothing had changed since the middle of the 18th century.
