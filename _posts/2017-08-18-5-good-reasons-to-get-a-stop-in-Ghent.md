> If you plan a trip to Belgium, make a stop in Ghent. Remember: there’s no place that captures best the essence of Flanders.
Gent is the jewel of **East Flanders**. History and legend come together in this pretty medieval town. Winter, although very hard, is the perfect season to appreciate local folklore. All Northern Belgium traits are cutely enclosed in Ghent. Canals, bridges, gothic buildings, colors and many towers decorate the city. If Amsterdam is the “Venice of the North”, Ghent is the pocket version.

### 1. Ghent or Brugge?

**If you do not  like tourist itinerary** the answer is Ghent. Souvenir shops and tourists making pictures are everywhere also in Ghent but, contrary to Brugge, here is easier to find peaceful spots where enjoy the magical atmosphere of East Flanders.
A hot coffee thermos, curiosity and wool scarves are the ingredients to enjoy the city. And then, let the wind brush your cheeks.
### 2. A little bite of art

The **Saint Bavo Cathedral** is one of many Romanesque churches adorning Belgium.
Walking between stained glasses and famous flemish paintings is always amazing.
The Sintbaafskathedral hosts the “Adoration of the Mystic Lamb” by the **Van Eyck brothers**. The masterpiece was stolen by Nazis and then it was saved by The Monuments Men after the World War II.

Facing the cathedral stands the **Belfort**, the medieval bell tower World Heritage Site. Don’t give up climbing: the gorgeous view from 95 meters will repay the effort!Beauty and history that Belgium offers ticket free.

The best way to enjoy the medieval atmosphere in Ghent is to walk on the cobblestones of the Castle. During the Middle Ages the **Castle of the Counts of Flanders** was used for many aims: first as a courthouse, and then also as a prison, decayed and even as a factory. Today, it has been repaired enough to allow people to take a stroll through it and climb on top. The building is still partly surrounded by the moat and inside you can visit a museum with various torture devices (and a _guillotine_) that were historically used in Ghent.

![Ghent Town Hall](/assets/images/ghent-hall.jpg)

By traveling throughout Belgian cities you get used to see, in each of it, the "grote markt", typical triangular squares with their Town Halls and the guildhalls that overlook on it (for example the [Brussels' Grote Markt](http://allthesmalltrips.life/trips/2017/10/13/bruxelles.html) if the most famous one and UNESCO World Heritage Site).

![Stepped gable roofs](/assets/images/belgian-roofs.jpg)

Curiously, in Ghent, you have no one Grote Markt, but The Town Hall is very impressive and there are small but nice squares everywhere. As you can see all over Belgium, many buildings have a particular **roofline design**.  It is called "crow-stepped gable" and, to be exact, Ghent has the oldest design _corbie step_ roof date from the 12th century.

### 3. A sweet pit-stop

![Cafes on the canal](/assets/images/ghent-cafes.jpg)

Ghent downtown is full of tea rooms and inns. Choose the one that appeals to you the most and fill up on hot drinks and baked goodies.
At the [“Platte Beurs”](http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/blrto_01600123?pid=4631448) the hot chocolate is among the best I’ve ever tasted. The roaring fire makes this inn the perfect pit stop for your stay in Gent.
### 4. Noses are red, violets are blue… Ghent, I love you!

The **Cuberdon**, known as Gentse Neuzen, are the Gent treats for excellence. And you will not find them anywhere else!
These gum arabic candies, because of their preparation, are difficult to export.  So they’re not recommended as a souvenir.

![Cherry Cuberdon](/assets/images/gentse-nozen.jpg)

Cherry “noses” and the black ones are the testiest. Avoid purple lavender Cuberdon, stick to the classic!

### 5. Belgium means crafting beer

![Gentse Strop](/assets/images/gentse-strop.JPG)

After a walking day with thermometer that marks -3°, relaxing in a trendy pub is the most loved conclusion here. I recommend you to order a Gentse Strop: **local beers** are always good and they never disappoint.
If you don’t like beer, Belgium will change you tastes. A crafting beers is “art”as much as Rubens’ paintings.
