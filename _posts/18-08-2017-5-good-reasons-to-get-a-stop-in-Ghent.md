If you plan a trip to Belgium, make a stop in Ghent. Remember: there’s no place that captures best the essence of  Flanders.
Gent is the jewel of East Flanders. History and legend come together in this pretty medieval town. Winter, although very hard, is the perfect season to appreciate local folklore. All Northern Belgium traits are cutely enclosed in Ghent. Canals, bridges, gothic buildings, colors and many towers decorate the city. If Amsterdam is the “Venice of the North”, Ghent is the pocket version

1.Ghent or Brugge? 
If you do not  like tourist itinerary the answer is Ghent. Souvenir shops and tourists making pictures are everywhere also in Ghent. But the the atmosphere is very magical and it is difficult to describe it by words.
A hot coffee thermos, curiosity and wool scarves are the ingredients to enjoy the city. And then, let the wind brushes your cheeks.
2. A little bite of art
The Saint Bavo Cathedral is one of many Romanesque churches adorning Belgium.
Walking between stained glasses and famous flemish paintings is always amazing.
The Sintbaafskathedral hosts the “Adoration of the Mystic Lamb” by the Van Eyck brothers. The masterpiece was stolen by Nazis and then it was saved by The Monuments Men after the World War II. 
Facing the cathedral stands the Belfort, the medieval bell tower Heritage Site. Don’t give up climbing: the gorgeous view from 95 meters will repay the effort!Beauty and history that Belgium offers ticket free.
3. A sweet pit-stop 
Ghent downtown is full of tea rooms and inns. Choose the one that appeals to you the most and fill up on hot drinks and baked goodies.
At the “Platte Beurs” the hot chocolate is among the best I’ve ever tasted. The roaring fire makes this inn the perfect pit stop for your stay in Gent.
4. Noses are red, violets are blue… Ghent I love you!
The Cuberdon, known as Gentse Neuzen, are the Gent treats for excellence. And you will not find them anywhere else!
These gum arabic candies, because of their preparation, are difficult to export.  So they’re not recommended as a souvenir.
Cherry “noses” and the black ones are the testiest. Avoid purple lavender Cuberdon, stick to the classic!
 5. Belgium means crafting beer
After a walking day with thermometer that marks -3°, relaxing in a trendy pub is the most loved conclusion here. I recommend you to order a Gentse Strop: local beers are always good and they never disappoint.
If you don’t like beer, Belgium will change you tastes. A crafting beers is “art”as much as Rubens’ paintings.
