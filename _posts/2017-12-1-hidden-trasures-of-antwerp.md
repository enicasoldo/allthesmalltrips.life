There is a small square in the centre of Antwerp that has stolen my heart since the first time I came across into it. It is Hendrik Conscience square, an amazing corner in the centre of Antwerp that I found when I was still leaving in the Flemish capital.


Hendrik Conscience square is set just close to the Grote Markt and the Groenplaats and, in spite of the noise and crowd of the city centre, it is quiet place with a surreal atmosphere, as if time has stopped.
The way I discovered Hendrik Conscienceplein was surreal too. It was a Saturday morning of the last summer: I was walking hand in hand with my boyfriend when we suddenly heard someone playing Ennio Morricone's famous theme by flute. By following the sound, we came out of this Square with baroque buildings ovelooking the cobblestones avenue, some students reading on the benches and this street artist playing his flute in the shade of a tree. It has been love at the first sight!
Hendrik Conscience square is also known as the "Italian square", because of its history and architecture. As a matter of fact, the building you notice first when you run into the square is the famous Saint Charles Borromeo's church, a stunning baroque catholic church, built  by jesuits in 1615. It is a beautiful church that still hosts some Rubens's paintings and other famous Flemish artists' masterpieces.
A unique feature of this church is the original, functioning mechanism above the main altar used to switch paintings: an impressive spectacle.
In front of the Church you can admire the Library building:  Blogger and copyrighter for two travel blogs.
