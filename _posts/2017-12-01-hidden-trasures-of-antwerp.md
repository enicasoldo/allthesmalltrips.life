_Antwerp is one of the most visited cities of Belgium. Although it is the capital of Flanders, Antwerpen or Anvers, is a city easy to go around, with a small centre and many cafes and casual restaurants._

### 1. Hendrick Coscience Square

Everyone in Italy awaits for this event. People stops during this night: they waits for their rain of falling stars sitting on the beach, camping in the woods or, in any case, far from city lights. Since I was a child I&#39;ve always waited for this night and, most of the time, I was a lucky girl: I saw a falling star and I made my wish. Until yesterday. From Paris up It is often cloudy or rainy, even in summer. It was the first time I missed my St. Lawrence&#39; night, and that thing made me sad but proud at the same time. I realise that I come from a romantic country where summer means not only &#34;holidays&#34;. Summer is something people really wait for the whole year and where time flows in a different way. In Italy summer is a lifestyle. It is a mood.</a></p> <p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;">A post shared by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/enicasoldo/" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;" target="_blank"> Enica Soldo üåç</a> (@enicasoldo) on <time style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;" datetime="2017-08-11T10:09:14+00:00">Aug 11, 2017 at 3:09am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src="//www.instagram.com/embed.js"></script>

There is a small square in the centre of Antwerp that has stolen my heart since the first time I came across into it.  


Hendrik Conscience Square is set just close to the _Grote Markt_ and the _Groenplaats_ and, in spite of the noise and crowd of the city centre, it is a quiet place with a surreal atmosphere, as if time had stopped.  

It was a Saturday morning of the last summer: while I was walking, I suddenly heard someone playing Ennio Morricone's famous theme. By following the sound, I came out of this Square with baroque buildings overlooking the cobblestones avenue, some students were reading on the benches and that street artist was playing his flute in the shade of a tree. It has been love at the first sight!

Hendrik Conscience Square is also known as the "Italian square", because of its history and architecture.  

As a matter of fact, the building you notice first when you run into the square is the famous Saint Charles Borromeo's Church, a stunning baroque catholic church, built  by Jesuits in 1615.

It is a beautiful church that still hosts some Rubens's paintings and other famous Flemish artists' masterpieces.
A unique feature of this church is the original, functioning mechanism above the main altar used to switch paintings: an impressive spectacle.

In front of the Church you can admire the Library building, that houses inside a real wonder: the Nottebohm Room. The Room dates back to 1936 and is a beautiful old section of the library containing the oldest books of the library and, also, a globe by Willem Jansz Blaeu.  

### 2. De Koninck Brewery   

![De Koninck Brewery Building](/assets/images/de-koninck-anterp.jpg)



Everybody knows that, in Belgium, beer is not only a drink: it is  lifestyle and, even, an ancient art.

Every Belgian city has its own beers, so there are many breweries spread all over Belgium. And Antwerp is no exception.  

BUt the De Koninck Brewery of Antwerp has something that noboby else has: it is set in the middle of the city and has got a museum right inside it!

When you visit the De Koninck brewery, you can stroll around looking at people working and taste the wort (the infused grain used to make beer).

They show you the beer production process step by step, by using videos and exhibitions. One thing, in particular, has impressed me: each beer has its own glasses, and each glass is the product of engineering study aimed to gives you the best smell and flavor.

A TIP  
_A beer tasting is included in the ticket. At the end of the visit, you can ask for it at the Museum Restaurant and enjoy your beers with cheese and salami. Pay attention: try to have only one sip for each glass of beer they give you if you do not want to leave the brewery drunk!_

###  Museum Plantin-Moretus

I am used to define the Museum Plantin-Moretus the "hidden gem" of Antwerp, because really a lot of people, even the ones living in Antwerp for years, do not know this museum. And it is World Heritage Site!  

![Plantin-Moretus Printing House](/assets/images/plantin-moretus.jpg)


The Plantin-Moretus Palace was both the house and the workplace of the Plantin-Moretus family. These family members were the Steve Jobs and Zuckerberg of the XVI century: in 1555 Christoffel Plantijn published his first book and, soon, important writers and scientists find their way to his printing house.  


WHAT YOU CAN VISIT:  

THE PRINTING SHOP   

![](/assets/images/tipography.jpg)

The printing house is the heart of the Plantin Palace. Here you will find the two oldest printing presses in the world.  

A TIP  
_Do not be shy: at the ground floor, there is a man who shows visitors how the old presses works and allows them to try the press and to print a text!_  

THE BIG LIBRARY  

![](/assets/images/library.jpg)

The large library is arranged as a rich 17th-century private library. Christoffel Plantin started them up and Balthasar I built them further.  

THE GARDEN  

![](/assets/images/garden.jpg)

The courtyard, together with the beautiful house, made this place into a tourist attraction already in the time of Plantin. Kings, princes and prominent people came to visit it. Nowadays, in the garden you can still see and smell popular plants from the 16th and 17th century.

It is worth to come to Antwerp even just to visit Plantin_Moretus Printing House.  
Walking along its rooms and looking at the work took place here centuries ago, you can be aware how the press invention was as wonderful as the digital era we are living in.  


### 4. ~~French~~ Belgian [Frietjes](https://allthesmalltrips.life/trips/2017/10/28/brussels-one-day-trip.html)  


![](/assets/images/fries.jpg)

Fries are one of the best food made in Belgium. It could seem weird that a simple food like fried potatoes can be so famous. But if you want to do something you have to do it well. And it is world it is worldwide recognized that Belgian do best fries ever.  

There is a place in Antwerp where you can eat very tasted frietjes: the ["Frites Atelier Amsterdam"] (https://www.fritesatelieramsterdam.com/)has, of course, amazing fries but, also, a large selection of sauces and a very nice location.  

![](/assets/images/patate.jpg)

Keep it in mind: Belgian are extremely sensitive about this national dish: call them Belgian fries or simply fries. Everything but French fries.  

I think these four ones are the things people, usually, miss when they visit Antwerp. As a matter of fact, I spent almost two years in Antwerp but I discovered its best part only a few months before leaving.
