I have been in _Belgium _several times in the last two years but I haven’t visit its capital until last August. So I set to explore this city in a one day trip before leaving Flanders: I could never move away without see Brussels, heart of Europe and multicultural community example.
Brussels is only one hour by train from Antwerp, the city where I’ve lived: 60 km that draws all the possible differences that could exist between cities in the same country.  The Belgian capital is a fairly compact city where It is easy to go around by foot for a seesighting of the main spots of interest.
Like I did for Copenhagen, I booked the free tour with SANDEMAN’s NEW Europe tours: it is a valiant option if you prefer to enjoy a new city  in an unconventional way.  The guides are more experienced and enthusiastic compared to the classical tourist tours and they usually are young and motivated. I fell in love with these kind of making tours because they perfectly reflect my way of traveling: not just see places and do things, but also understand cultures, meet people and even change your mind.
My walking tour with the nice Magali started at 11 AM in Grand Place,  the central square in the city and UNESCO World Heritage Site. Every main city in Belgium and Netherlands has its Grote Markt, which is a common name of centrally located historic market square.Three historical buildings rise up in Brussels Grote Markt: the Town Hall, The Breadhouse and the guildhalls. I was amazed by the particular architecture and history of the town hall: it is the only one wholly survived to the the Second World War which is full of curiosities and legends.
It was a lucky trip for me because I visited Brussels just the 15th of August. In effect, when I got there, I discovered that every two years, only in August, the whole square is transformed into a giant flower carpet thanks to the millions of begonias brought there to create a colourful masterpiece. 
Just few blocks off the Grand Place you stumble across the Belgium famous Manneken Pis,   a tiny fountain depicting a young boy peeing. There has been much speculation about the origins of this hilarious bronze sculpture: the truth is that nobody knows who he was and why has become the symbol of a country! The funny thing is that the small statue has a range of clothes made for him; they’re about over 900 outfits, all of them set in a museum and known as GardeRobe. Come back in Christmas Day to see him in a Santa outfit!
After a quick look after the “little boy”, I head to a lively corner next Place de la Bourse, a square most of the time neglected by travel blogs and avoided by guides. Once this place was afflicted by the terrible plague and for that completely razed. Long after the Belgians built here a stunning neoclassical Stock Exchange building that nowadays hosts exhibitions and events! I particularly enjoyed to take a stroll across these cheerful pathways: bars, pubs and shops are everywhere while at Fritland, in Rue Henri Maus, you could taste the best fries ever. A tip: locals suggested not to ask for “French” fries, they are extremely sensitive about it. It’s better if you order “Belgian fries” or simply “fries”. Look: authentic “frietjes” are cooked with lard and not with vegetal oil, that’s the secret of their flavourful.
The Galleries Royals Saint Hubert was a real discovery for me. I looked up at it and I said: “They have made copy of the one of Milan!”. Instead it was just the opposite thing! The ones of Milan and Naples were inspired by the Brussels’ Gallery that opened in 1847.  It was designed as a commercial building for aristocracy and consists in two main sections, the King’s Gallery and the Queen’s Gallery, and a smaller side called Princess’ gallery.
Today it hosts over 50 shops and two theaters. According to an historical anecdote the Lumière brothers played here one of their first movies.


When I stood in front of the Cathedral of Saint Michael and Gudula the first thing I thought was “Notre-Dame!”. In effect this building, that is also UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a typical gothic church with stained glasses and lancet arches. Belgian people are extremely respectful of religion and spirituality. Please, if you decide to enter this sacred space, be silent and respectful too. 

The Royal Palace of Brussels is open to the public two weeks per year, usually in summer. It is possible to walk the beautiful ball rooms, the old team roomd e bed rooms where kings an d queens di dono succedute nei secoli. Today the royals of Belgium che si sono evoluti in una senso moderno e concepiscono il loro lorio in modo diverso, abitano solo una parte di queste stanze ora quasi del tutto cocepite come bene fruibile dalla comunità europea intera.

If you go to belgium you can’t go back home without buy, or al teast taste, the delicious belgian chocolates. avoid the franchise e commercial shops;  
ary’s and the one whou invented pralines. 

Bruxelles, like every capital in the world, is a mix of night and day. Indeed, durind history, Belgium was caracterized by colonialism, wars, slavery but also courage and . there ias a man who best of them emboby all the elements of this nation: king albert the first. He was small brave man which fight during the firt war to defend the neutraluty and the peace.in his people. “Belgium is a country not a road”, he answered to germany ultimatum by showing a streght that nobidy had ever imagened.This is Belgium: a build born for strategial aimsi but that in the deacdes raises a dignity and streght despite his small measures.
